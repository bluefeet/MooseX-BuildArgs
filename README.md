# NAME

MooseX::BuildArgs - Save the original constructor arguments for later use.

# SYNOPSIS

Create a class that uses this module:

```perl
package MyClass;
use Moose;
use MooseX::BuildArgs;
has foo => ( is=>'ro', isa=>'Str' );

my $object = MyClass->new( foo => 32 );
print $object->build_args->{foo};
```

# DESCRIPTION

Sometimes it is very useful to have access to the contructor arguments before builders,
defaults, and coercion take affect.  This module provides a build\_args hashref attribute
for all instances of the consuming class.  The build\_args attribute contains all arguments
that were passed to the constructor.

A contrived case for this module would be for creating a clone of an object, so you could
duplicate an object with the following code:

```perl
my $obj1 = MyClass->new( foo => 32 );
my $obj2 = MyClass->new( $obj1->build_args() );
print $obj2->foo();
```
